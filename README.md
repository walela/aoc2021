# AOC 2021

These are my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) 2021 challenge.

I don't have any particular goals but I'll be writing my solutions in [Go](https://go.dev)
to practice the language.

The plan is to improve the solutions as I go (ðŸ˜œ) along and learn of more idiomatic patterns and/or  
better algorithms.

To run a solution `cd` into the specific day's directory and run `go run main.go`
